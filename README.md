The files in this repository are for the paper titled: "Mn2+ accelerates ligand binding-site activation of αIIbβ3 integrin: insight from all-atom simulation" By R.E. Coffman, R. Kolasangiani, and T.C. Bidone

List of File Types:
.xtc: Trajectory files are in .xtc format and have been reduced considerably to fit in this repository.
.pdb:

.matlab

state1 through state8 .pdb files are the hand edited files used for further processing and simulation. They are derived from
3zdy, 3zdz, 3ze0, 3ze1, and 3ze2.

For minimization and equilibration, the .mdp files were used in the following order:
ions.mdp
minim.mdp
nvt.mdp
npt.mdp
mdreplica.mdp
